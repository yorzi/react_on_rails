## Manual Installation
Follow these steps if you choose to forgo the generator:

1. Globally expose React in your webpack config like [this](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/537c985dc82faee333d80509343ca32a3965f9dd/client/webpack.client.base.config.js#L31):
  
  ```javascript
  module: {
    loaders: [
      // React is necessary for the client rendering:
      { test: require.resolve('react'), loader: 'expose?React' },
    
      // For React 0.14
      { test: require.resolve('react-dom'), loader: 'expose?ReactDOM' }, // not in the server one
  ```
    
    
2. Require `react_on_rails` in your `application.js` like  [this](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/361f4338ebb39a5d3934b00cb6d6fcf494773000/app/assets/javascripts/application.js#L15). It possibly should come after you require `turbolinks`:
  
  ```
  //= require react_on_rails
  ```
3. Expose your client globals like [this](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/537c985dc82faee333d80509343ca32a3965f9dd/client/app/startup/clientGlobals.jsx#L3):
  
  ```javascript
  import App from './ClientApp';
  window.App = App;
  ```
4. Put your client globals file as webpack entry points like [this](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/537c985dc82faee333d80509343ca32a3965f9dd/client/webpack.client.rails.config.js#L22). Similar pattern for server rendering.
  
  ```javascript
  config.entry.app.push('./app/startup/clientGlobals');
  ```

## Additional Steps For Server Rendering (option `prerender` shown below)
See the next section for a sample webpack.server.rails.config.js.

1. Expose your server globals like [this](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/537c985dc82faee333d80509343ca32a3965f9dd/client/app/startup/serverGlobals.jsx#L7)
   
  ```javascript
  import App from './ServerApp';
  global.App = App;
  ```
2. Make the server globals file an entry point in your webpack config, like [this](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/537c985dc82faee333d80509343ca32a3965f9dd/client/webpack.server.rails.config.js#L7)

  ```javascript
  entry: ['./app/startup/serverGlobals'],
  ```
3. Ensure the name of your ouput file (shown [here](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/537c985dc82faee333d80509343ca32a3965f9dd/client/webpack.server.rails.config.js#L9)) of your server bundle corresponds to the configuration of the gem. The default path is `app/assets/javascripts/generated`. See below for customization of configuration variables.
4. Expose `React` in your webpack config, like [this](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/master/client/webpack.server.rails.config.js#L23)

```javascript
{ test: require.resolve('react'), loader: 'expose?React' },

// For React 0.14
{ test: require.resolve('react-dom/server'), loader: 'expose?ReactDOMServer' }, // not in client one, only server
```

#### Sample webpack.server.rails.config.js (ONLY for server rendering)
Be sure to check out the latest example version of [client/webpack.server.rails.config.js](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/master/client/webpack.server.rails.config.js).

```javascript
// Common webpack configuration for server bundle

module.exports = {

  // the project dir
  context: __dirname,
  entry: ['./app/startup/serverGlobals'],
  output: {
    filename: 'server-bundle.js',
    path: '../app/assets/javascripts/generated',

    // CRITICAL to set libraryTarget: 'this' for enabling Rails to find the exposed modules IF you
    //   use the "expose" webpackfunctionality. See startup/serverGlobals.jsx.
    // NOTE: This is NOT necessary if you use the syntax of global.MyComponent = MyComponent syntax.
    // See http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#externals for documentation of this option
    //libraryTarget: 'this',
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['', '.webpack.js', '.web.js', '.js', '.jsx', 'config.js'],
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {test: /\.jsx?$/, loader: 'babel-loader', exclude: /node_modules/},

      // React is necessary for the client rendering:
      { test: require.resolve('react'), loader: 'expose?React' },
      { test: require.resolve('react-dom/server'), loader: 'expose?ReactDOMServer' },
    ],
  },
};
```

### What Happens?

Here's what the browser will render with a call to the `react_component` helper.
![2015-09-28_20-24-35](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1118459/10157268/41435186-6624-11e5-9341-6fc4cf35ee90.png)
    
  If you're curious as to what the gem generates for the server and client rendering, see [`spec/dummy/client/app/startup/serverGlobals.jsx`](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/spec/dummy/spec/sample_generated_js/server-generated.js)
  and [`spec/dummy/client/app/startup/ClientReduxApp.jsx`](https://github.com/shakacode/react_on_rails/blob/master/spec/dummy/spec/sample_generated_js/client-generated.js) for examples of this. Note, this is not the code that you are providing. You can see the client code by viewing the page source.
  
* **props**: [hash | string of json] Properties to pass to the react object. See this example if you're using Jbuilder: [react-webpack-rails-tutorial view rendering props using jBuilder](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/blob/master/app/views/pages/index.html.erb#L20)

```erb
<%= react_component('App', render(template: "/comments/index.json.jbuilder"),
    generator_function: true, prerender: true) %>
```
* **options:** [hash]
  * **generator_function**: <true/false> default is false, set to true if you want to use a generator function rather than a React Component.
  * **prerender**: <true/false> set to false when debugging!
  * **trace**: <true/false> set to true to print additional debugging information in the browser default is true for development, off otherwise 
  * **replay_console**: <true/false> Default is true. False will disable echoing server rendering logs, which can make troubleshooting server rendering difficult.
  * Any other options are passed to the content tag, including the id. 

## JavaScript

1. Configure your webpack configuration to create the file used for server rendering if you plan to do server rendering.
2. Follow the examples in `spec/dummy/client/app/startup/clientGlobals.jsx` to expose your react components for client side rendering.

  ```ruby   
  import HelloWorld from '../components/HelloWorld';
  window.HelloWorld = HelloWorld;
  ```   
3. Follow the examples in `spec/dummy/client/app/startup/serverGlobals.jsx` to expose your react components for server side rendering.

  ```ruby
  import HelloWorld from '../components/HelloWorld';
  global.HelloWorld = HelloWorld;
  ```
   
## Server Rendering Tips

- Your code can't reference `document`. Server side JS execution does not have access to `document`, so jQuery and some
  other libs won't work in this environment. You can debug this by putting in `console.log`
  statements in your code.
- You can conditionally avoid running code that references document by passing in a boolean prop to your top level react
  component. Since the passed in props Hash from the view helper applies to client and server side code, the best way to
  do this is to use a generator function.

You might do something like this in some file for your top level component:
```javascript
global.App = () => <MyComponent serverSide={true} />;
```

The point is that you have separate files for top level client or server side, and you pass some extra option indicating that rendering is happening server sie.

## Optional Configuration   

Create a file `config/react_on_rails.rb` to override any defaults. If you don't specify this file,
the default options are below.

The `server_bundle_js_file` must correspond to the bundle you want to use for server rendering.

```ruby
# Shown below are the defaults for configuration
ReactOnRails.configure do |config|
  # Client bundles are configured in application.js
  # Server bundle is a single file for all server rendering of components.
  config.server_bundle_js_file = "app/assets/javascripts/generated/server.js" # This is the default

  # Below options can be overriden by passing to the helper method.
  config.prerender = false # default is false
  config.generator_function = false # default is false, meaning that you expose ReactComponents directly
  config.trace = Rails.env.development? # default is true for development, off otherwise

  # For server rendering. This can be set to false so that server side messages are discarded.
  config.replay_console = true # Default is true. Be cautious about turning this off.
  config.logging_on_server = true # Default is true. Logs server rendering messags to Rails.logger.info
  
  # Settings for the pool of renderers:
  config.server_renderer_pool_size  ||= 1  # ExecJS doesn't allow more than one on MRI
  config.server_renderer_timeout    ||= 20 # seconds
end
```

You can configure your pool of JS virtual machines and specify where it should load code:

- On MRI, use `therubyracer` for the best performance (see [discussion](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails/pull/290))
- On MRI, you'll get a deadlock with `pool_size` > 1
- If you're using JRuby, you can increase `pool_size` to have real multi-threaded rendering.

## Tips
+ **DO NOT RUN `rails s`** and instead run `foreman start`
+ The default for rendering right now is `prerender: false`. **NOTE:**  Server side rendering does not work for some components, namely react-router, that use an async setup for server rendering. You can configure the default for prerender in your config.
+ You can expose either a React component or a function that returns a React component. If you wish to create a React component via a function, rather than simply props, then you need to set the property "generator" on that function to true. When that is done, the function is invoked with a single parameter of "props", and that function should return a React element. 
+ Be sure you can first render your react component client only before you try to debug server rendering!
+ Open up the HTML source and take a look at the generated HTML and the JavaScript to see what's going on under the covers. Note that when server rendering is turned on, then you'll see the server rendered react components. When server rendering is turned off, then you'll only see the `div` element where the in-line JavaScript will render the component. You might also notice how the props you pass (a Ruby Hash) becomes in-line JavaScript on the HTML page.

## React 0.13 vs. React 0.14
The main difference for using react_on_rails is that you need to add additional lines in the webpack config files:

+ Normal mode (JavaScript is rendered on the client side) webpack config file:

  ```javascript
  { test: require.resolve('react-dom'), loader: 'expose?ReactDOM' },
  ```
+ Server-side rendering webpack config file:

  ```javascript
  { test: require.resolve('react-dom/server'), loader: 'expose?ReactDOMServer' },
  ```
